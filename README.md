### Briefly Introduction 
With the help of data holder BADANJAK Sanja, we use the data from PA-X Corpus to focus on vulnerable groups (Children/Youth, Refugees/displaced persons, Elderly/Age, Disabled persons), targeting European peace-loving persons as the audience, combining With AR technology. We hope to design a set of cards as promotional materials, to call everyone to pay attention to the interests of the vulnerable people in war-torn areas, and call on the government to put forward more pragmatic policies to protect vulnerable groups when signing a peace agreement.
